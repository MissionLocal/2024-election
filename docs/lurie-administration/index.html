            <!-- <h2>Latest on Lurie's appointment</h2> -->
            <p class="intro-graf">Mayor-elect Daniel Lurie today announced his first batch of appointments, naming three key roles in the mayor's office: longtime former San Francisco Giants executive Staci Slaughter as chief of staff, his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/10/see-how-they-run-daniel-lurie-greets-voters-in-the-castro-and-in-heat-wave/">mayoral campaign senior advisor</a> Matthew Goudeau as deputy chief of staff, and his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/05/see-how-they-run-door-knocking-genius-han-zou-joins-team-lurie/">campaign manager Han Zou</a>, as director of public affairs.</p> 
            <p class="intro-graf">Prior to Lurie's appointment, the mayor-elect also revealed his plan to <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/12/sf-mayor-daniel-lurie-changing-mayors-office-deputy-mayors-policy-chiefs/">overhaul the mayor's office and bring in four policy chiefs</a> to serve as his deputy-like mayors. The 1991 Proposition H forbade deputy mayors and regulated salaries of deputy-like aides to 70 percent of the mayor's salary. In the pre-1991 system, the deputies supervised city departments and that is what Lurie's yet-to-be-announced aides will do as well.</p>
            <p class="intro-graf">As Lurie rolls out more details about his administration, we are keeping track of the appointments on this live page, which will be updated with each new appointment. You will be able to see the comings and goings at the major city departments and the mayor's office as they happen.</p>

                Tumlin's contract as the head of SFMTA expires this month. It's unclear if he wants to continue, but five years into his job, Tumlin is in the hot seat, facing a series of challenges including the problem-ridden Muni system and controversial <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/09/new-valencia-bike-lane-design-unveiled-side-running-floating-parklets-parking-protected-bikeway/">bike lanes</a>, as well as a projected <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/weigh-sfmtas-fy-2024-2025-and-fy-2025-2026-budget">$240 million</a> department deficit starting in 2026. Tumlin was the former director of strategy at Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates, a transportation-system planning and design firm. Prior to his leading role at SFMTA, Tumlin had almost no experience managing city agencies or transit systems. The only exception was the nine months he spent in 2016 as interim director setting up Oakland's Department of Transportation. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>

                Zou has been the campaign manager for Lurie's mayoral campaign since May 2024. Previously, Zou was known in the political scene as the door-knocking genius who helped Assemblymember Matt Haney sway Asian voters in his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/04/election-2022-what-to-watch-for-in-haney-campos-assembly-race/">winning assembly race</a> in 2022 and, before that, his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2018/11/election-2018-how-matt-haney-surprised-everyone-even-himself/">District 6 supervisor race</a> in 2018. In this election, Zou, along with Kit Lam, the campaign's Chinese community-outreach lead and a school board recall activist, helped create a landslide victory among Asian voters. As Mission Local's Yujie Zhou reported, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/11/daniel-lurie-won-asian-votes-but-how/">almost every heavily Asian precinct marked Lurie as their first choice</a>, including neighborhoods such as the Sunset, the Richmond, the Excelsior, Portola, Visitacion Valley, and Chinatown. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>
