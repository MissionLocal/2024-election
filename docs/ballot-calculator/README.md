# Methodology:

San Francisco uses the ranked-choice voting system. With each round of results, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to other candidates. The process is repeated until a candidate reaches a majority.

So for this story, we are only using the number of first-choice votes received by candidates. The data was downloaded from the San Francisco Department of Elections.

The totals spent on ballot measures and candidates reflect expenditures electronically filed with the San Francisco Ethics Commission prior to 1 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2024.

If any political action group spent oppositional money on a candidate, that amount is counted as money spent supporting the candidate that group endorsed in the race. For example, money spent opposing Marjan Philhour by labor union PACs is counted as supporting her opponent Connie Chan in the District 1 supervisor race.

If a PAC endorsed more than one candidate in the same race, that total amount will be counted for each candidate. For example in District 3, $55,746 was spent opposing Danny Sauter by the labor union PAC that endorsed both Sharon Lai and Moe Jamil. Therefore, $55,746 is counted as supporting Lai and $55,746 supporting Jamil.

If a PAC is spending on different ballot measures, that total amount will be counted for each measure. For example, a PAC spent $6,016,377 supporting Prop. D and opposing Prop. E. That $6 million is counted both for Prop. D, and against Prop. E.
