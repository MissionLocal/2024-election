            <p>“Our children can't even enjoy the park, Wagner said. “My son barely comes outside.”</p>
            <p>This, Wager said, is because her neighborhood sticks out like a “sore thumb” compared to other areas of the city.</p>
            <p>“That neighborhood doesn't have homeless, this does,” Wagner continued. “That neighborhood doesn't have poop and pee, this does.”</p>
            <p>When there's an event or a visitor, Wagner said, the city “cleans up real good.”</p>
            <p>“I need them to use their money to clean the whole city, not just some parts when they want,” she sighed. “It's making me feel like because of the color of my skin you're putting me over here and I'm supposed to live in a feces-infested neighborhood and it's not fair.”</p>"

            <p>While the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency just raised bus fares this January and more service cuts may happen with the agency's budget deficit, what the mayor can do, Carr said, is to “assess who are using the bus lines.” In richer neighborhoods, people may not use the bus as often, but in places like Potrero Hill or Chinatown, “People need a bus.”</p>"

            <p>Although bike infrastructures may not be the battles he chooses, he believes the new administration could do other things. For example, there could be less policing and better ways to tackle homelessness, he added. The homeless sweeps ahead of the 2023 APEC and last August, to him, were “temporary efforts.”</p>
            <p>“If you can mobilize that many cops to sweep, you can make them do more beneficial things,” he said.</p>
            <p>He also hopes the new administration will change the zoning restrictions, especially in the Sunset, loosening the heights limits. T“Sunset is big, and imagine having another Sunset on top of the Sunset,” he said. “It's literally double the amount of housing.”</p>"
